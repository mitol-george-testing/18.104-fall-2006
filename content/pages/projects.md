In this undergraduate level seminar for mathematics majors, students present and discuss subject matter taken from current journals or books.

Sample Student Work
-------------------

All student work is used with permission.

### Presentations

The students will take turns giving presentations using slides (computer or overhead projector). This is an interactive session, therefore attendance is required.

### Paper

Each student will write a paper on a topic related to the course. It must be written in Latex and approximately ten pages long. The writing should be aimed at a typical MIT math major, and it should reflect the student's own understanding of the subject.
